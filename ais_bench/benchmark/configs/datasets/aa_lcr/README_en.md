[中文](README.md) | English

## Dataset Introduction

AA-LCR (Artificial Analysis Long Context Retrieval) is a benchmark for evaluating language models' long-context retrieval and reasoning capabilities. The task requires models to search for and synthesize information across multiple documents to answer questions.

## Dataset Deployment

- The dataset can be obtained from the ModelScope dataset link: 🔗 [https://modelscope.cn/datasets/evalscope/AA-LCR](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/evalscope/AA-LCR).
- The AA-LCR dataset is in compressed archive format and is recommended to be deployed in the `{tool_root_path}/ais_bench/datasets/AA-LCR/` directory.

- Execute `tree AA-LCR/` in the `{tool_root_path}/ais_bench/datasets/` directory to check the directory structure. If the directory structure is as shown below, the dataset has been deployed successfully:
    ```
    AA-LCR/
    └── extracted_text/
        └── AA-LCR_extracted-text.zip
    ```
