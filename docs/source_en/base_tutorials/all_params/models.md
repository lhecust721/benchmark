# Model Configuration Instructions
AISBench Benchmark supports two types of model backends:
- [Service-Oriented Inference Backend](#service-oriented-inference-backend)
- [Local Model Backend](#local-model-backend)

> ⚠️ **Note**: The two types of backends cannot be specified simultaneously.


## Service-Oriented Inference Backend
AISBench Benchmark supports multiple service-oriented inference backends, including vLLM, SGLang, Triton, MindIE, TGI, etc. These backends receive inference requests and return results through exposed HTTP API interfaces. (HTTPS interfaces are not supported currently.)

Taking the vLLM inference service deployed on GPU as an example, you can refer to the [vLLM Official Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/quickstart.html) to start the service.

The model configurations corresponding to different service-oriented backends are as follows:

### Parameter Description for Service-Oriented Inference Backend Configuration
The configuration file for the service-oriented inference backend is configured using Python syntax, as shown in the example below:

```python
from ais_bench.benchmark.models import VLLMCustomAPI

models = [ # Equivalent to the `models` imported via `from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.models.vllm_api.vllm_api_general import models as vllm_api_general` in a custom configuration file
    dict(
        attr="service",
        type=VLLMCustomAPI,
        abbr='vllm-api-general',
        path="",                    # Specify the absolute path to the model serialized vocabulary file (generally not required for accuracy testing scenarios)
        model="",        # Specify the name of the model loaded on the server, configured according to the actual model name pulled by the VLLM inference service (configuring an empty string will automatically retrieve it)
        stream=False,    # Whether it is a streaming interface
        request_rate = 0,           # Request sending frequency: send 1 request to the server every 1/request_rate seconds; if less than 0.1, all requests are sent at once
        use_timestamp=False,        # Whether to schedule requests by the dataset's timestamp; used with timestamped datasets (e.g. Mooncake Trace)
        retry = 2,                  # Maximum number of retries for each request
        api_key="",                 # Custom API key, default is an empty string
        host_ip = "localhost",      # Specify the IP address of the inference service
        host_port = 8080,           # Specify the port of the inference service

        max_out_len = 512,          # Maximum number of tokens output by the inference service
        batch_size=1,               # Maximum concurrency for request sending

            temperature = 0.01,
            ignore_eos=False,
        )
    )
]

```

The description of configurable parameters for the service-oriented inference backend is as follows:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Configuration Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `attr` | String | Identifier for the inference backend type, fixed as `service` (service-oriented inference) or `local` (local model); cannot be customized |
| `type` | Python Class | Class name of the API type, automatically associated by the system; no manual configuration is required by the user. Refer to [Service-Oriented Inference Backend](#service-oriented-inference-backend) |
| `abbr` | String | Unique identifier for the service-oriented task, used to distinguish different tasks. It consists of English characters and hyphens, e.g., `vllm-api-general-chat` |
| `path` | String | Tokenizer path, usually the same as the model path. The Tokenizer is loaded using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(path)`. Specify an accessible local path, e.g., `/weight/DeepSeek-R1`. The final directory name must stay consistent with the model name in model repositories such as Hugging Face, ModelScope, or Modelers; do not rename it arbitrarily, otherwise the model name may fail to be parsed (e.g., [response anomaly detection](../../advanced_tutorials/response_anomaly_detection.md) derives the model name from this path) |
| `model` | String | Name of the model accessible on the server, which must be consistent with the name specified during service-oriented deployment |
| `model_name` | String | Applicable only to Triton services. It is concatenated into the endpoint URI `/v2/models/{modelname}/{infer, generate, generate_stream}` and must be consistent with the name used during deployment |
| `stream` | Boolean | API model inference interface type. The default is False, meaning a non-streaming interface. When True, it indicates a streaming interface (for details, refer to 🔗 [Service-Oriented Inference Backend](#service-oriented-inference-backend)) |
| `request_rate` | Float | Request sending rate (unit: seconds), a request is sent every `1/request_rate` seconds; in pressure testing scenarios, it represents the number of new server-side connections added per second; if the value is less than 0.1, the request sending rate is unlimited. Valid range: [0, 64000]. When the `traffic_cfg` item is enabled, this function may be overwritten (for specific reasons, refer to 🔗 [Parameter Interpretation Section in the Description of Request Rate (RPS) Distribution Control and Visualization](../../advanced_tutorials/rps_distribution.md#parameter-interpretation)) |
| `use_timestamp` | Boolean | Whether to schedule requests according to the dataset's timestamp field. When True and the dataset contains timestamps, requests are sent by timestamp and **request_rate** / **traffic_cfg** are ignored; when False, request_rate and traffic_cfg apply. Default False. Used with timestamped datasets (e.g. Mooncake Trace). |
| `traffic_cfg` | Dict | Parameters for controlling fluctuations in the request sending rate (for detailed usage instructions, refer to 🔗 [Description of Request Rate (RPS) Distribution Control and Visualization](../../advanced_tutorials/rps_distribution.md)). If this item is not filled in, the function is disabled by default |
| `retry` | Int | Maximum number of retries after failing to connect to the server. Valid range: [0, 1000] |
| `api_key` | String | Custom API key, default is an empty string. Only supports the `VLLMCustomAPI` and `VLLMCustomAPIChat` model type. |
| `host_ip` | String | Server IP address, supporting valid IPv4 or IPv6, e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `::1`. When using an IPv6 literal, the tool automatically wraps it in brackets when building URLs, for example: `http://[::1]:8080/` |
| `host_port` | Int | Server port number, which must be consistent with the port specified during service-oriented deployment |
| `url` | String | Custom URL path for accessing the inference service (needs to be configured when the base URL is not a combination of http://host_ip:host_port).For example, when `models`'s `type` is `VLLMCustomAPI`, configure `url` as `https://xxxxxxx/yyyy/`, the actual request URL accessed is `https://xxxxxxx/yyyy/v1/completions` |
| `max_out_len` | Int | Maximum output length of the inference response; the actual length may be limited by the server. |
| `batch_size` | Int | Batch size for concurrent requests. Valid range: (0, 64000] |
| `trust_remote_code` | Boolean | Whether the tokenizer trusts remote code, default is `False`|
| `generation_kwargs` | Dict | Configuration of inference generation parameters, depending on the specific service-oriented backend and interface type. Note: Currently, multi-sampling parameters such as `best_of` and `n` are not supported, but multiple independent inferences can be performed using the `num_return_sequences` parameter (for details, refer to 🔗 [the role of `num_return_sequences` in the Text Generation Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.18.0/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate.num_return_sequences\(int,)). Supports configuring `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` parameters to enable token probability information collection; see 🔗[Logprobs Collection and Analysis](../../advanced_tutorials/logprobs_collection.md) |
| `returns_tool_calls` | Bool | Controls the extraction method of function call information. When set to `True`, the system extracts function call information from the `tool_calls` field of the API response; when set to `False`, the system parses function call information from the `content` field |
| `pred_postprocessor` | Dict | Post-processing configuration for model output results. It is used to format, clean, or convert the original model output to meet the requirements of specific evaluation tasks |


**Precautions**:
- Response anomaly detection currently supports only the vLLM Chat API model configurations `vllm_api_general_chat`, `vllm_api_stream_chat`, and `vllm_api_stream_chat_multiturn`. Other model backends are not supported yet.
- `request_rate` is affected by hardware performance. You can increase 📚 [WORKERS_NUM](./cli_args.md#configuration-constant-file-parameters) to improve concurrency capability.
- The function of `request_rate` may be overwritten by the `traffic_cfg` item. For specific reasons, refer to 🔗 [Parameter Interpretation Section in the Description of Request Rate (RPS) Distribution Control and Visualization](../../advanced_tutorials/rps_distribution.md#parameter-interpretation).
- When the dataset has timestamps and **use_timestamp** is True in the model config, requests are scheduled by timestamp and **request_rate** and **traffic_cfg** are ignored.
- Setting `batch_size` too large may result in high CPU usage. Please configure it reasonably based on hardware conditions.
- The default service address used by the service-oriented inference evaluation API is `localhost:8080`. In actual use, you need to modify it to the IP and port of the service-oriented backend according to the actual deployment.
- When using an IPv6 literal (such as `::1` or `2001:db8::1`) as `host_ip`, the tool will automatically wrap it in brackets in the generated URL (for example, `http://[2001:db8::1]:8080/`), so you do not need to manually add brackets in the configuration.
- When response anomaly detection (`--response-anomaly`) is enabled, the service must return token ids and top-k logprobs; AISBench automatically adds `logprobs=True` and a fixed `top_logprobs=20` to the inference requests, and Cases whose responses lack these fields are marked as `skipped` in the detection results. See [Response Anomaly Detection](../../advanced_tutorials/response_anomaly_detection.md) for details.


### Multi-LoRA Routing

Route each sample to the correct LoRA adapter by `data_id` (dataset row index). Supported backends: `VLLMCustomAPIChat`, `VLLMCustomAPI`, `TGICustomAPI`, `MindieStreamApi`. No new model class is required; just add `lora_data_map_file` under `generation_kwargs`.

```python
from ais_bench.benchmark.models import VLLMCustomAPIChat

models = [
    dict(
        type=VLLMCustomAPIChat,
        abbr='vllm-chat-lora',
        host_ip='127.0.0.1', host_port=8080,
        generation_kwargs=dict(
            temperature=0,
            lora_data_map_file='./lora_data_map.json',
        ),
    ),
]
```

`lora_data_map.json` (key = stringified `data_id`, value = LoRA adapter name registered on the server):

```json
{"0": "LoraAdapter1", "1": "LoraAdapter2", "6": "LoraAdapter1"}
```

> ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Use an **absolute path** for `lora_data_map_file` to avoid resolution failures caused by different working directories.

| Backend class | Where LoRA is set in the request body | Corresponding preset configs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VLLMCustomAPIChat` | Overwrites `model` field with the adapter name | `vllm_api_general_chat`, `vllm_api_stream_chat`, `vllm_api_stream_chat_multiturn`, `vllm_api_function_call_chat` |
| `VLLMCustomAPI` | Overwrites `model` field with the adapter name | `vllm_api_general`, `vllm_api_general_stream` |
| `TGICustomAPI` | Sets `parameters.adapter_id` to the adapter name | `tgi_api_general` |
| `MindieStreamApi` | Sets `parameters.adapter_id` to the adapter name | `mindie_stream_api_general` |

- If the `data_id` is not in the mapping, the JSON file is missing/invalid, or `data_id` is absent → the request silently falls back to the base model (no error).
- Run with `--debug` (or set `verbose=True` in the model config) to log each routing decision as `[Multi-LoRA] data_id=... lora_model_name=...`.

| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Description & Configuration |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `attr` | String | Identifier for the backend type, fixed as `local` (local model) or `service` (service-oriented inference) |
| `type` | Python Class | Model class name, automatically associated by the system; no manual configuration is required by the user |
| `abbr` | String | Unique identifier for the local task, used to distinguish multiple tasks. It is recommended to use a combination of English characters and hyphens, e.g., `vllm-offline-vl-model` |
| `path` | String | Model weight path, which must be an accessible local path. The model is loaded using `vllm.LLM(model=path)`  |
| `model_kwargs` | Dict | LLM init params, refer 🔗 [LLM init params](https://docs.vllm.com.cn/en/latest/serving/engine_args.html#) |
| `sample_kwargs` | Dict | LLM sample params, refer 🔗 [sample params](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.6.5/dev/sampling_params.html) |
| `vision_kwargs` | Dict | multi-modal input params，refer 🔗 [multi-modal vllm offline inference](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.7.3/getting_started/examples/vision_language.html) |
| `max_out_len` | Int | Maximum number of output tokens generated by inference. |
| `batch_size` | Int | Batch size for inference requests. Valid range: (0, 64000] |
