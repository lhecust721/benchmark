## 🌏 Introduction
AISBench Benchmark is a model evaluation tool built based on [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass). It is compatible with OpenCompass's configuration system, dataset structure, and model backend implementation, and on this basis, extends support for service-deployed models.

Currently, AISBench supports evaluation scenarios for two major types of inference tasks:

🔍 [Accuracy Evaluation](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/home.html#id2): Supports accuracy verification of service-deployed models and local models on various question-answering and reasoning benchmark datasets, covering text, multimodal and other scenarios.

🚀 [Performance Evaluation](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/home.html#id5): Supports latency and throughput evaluation of service-deployed models, as well as extreme performance testing under stress test scenarios, supporting steady-state performance evaluation and real business traffic simulation.


## 🛠️ Tool Installation
✅ Environment Requirements

**Python Version**: Only Python **3.10**, **3.11** or **3.12** is supported.

Python 3.9 and below are not supported, nor are Python 3.13 and above.

**It is recommended to use Conda for environment management** to avoid dependency conflicts:
```shell
conda create --name ais_bench python=3.10 -y
conda activate ais_bench
```

### 📦 Installation Method - Source Code Installation (Preferred)

AISBench currently recommends the source code installation method for a better custom configuration file experience. Ensure the installation environment has internet access:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AISBench/benchmark.git
cd benchmark/
pip3 install -e ./ --use-pep517
```
This command will automatically install core dependencies.
Execute `ais_bench -h`. If the help information for all command-line options of the AISBench evaluation tool is printed, the installation is successful.

⚙️ Service Deployment Framework Support (Optional)

If you need to evaluate service-deployed models (such as vLLM, Triton, etc.), install additional dependencies:
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/api.txt
pip3 install -r requirements/extra.txt
```
⚙️ Huggingface Multi-modal Model/ vLLM Offline Inference Support（Optional）
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/hf_vl_dependency.txt
```
🔗 Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Evaluation Support
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/datasets/bfcl_dependencies.txt --no-deps
```

**Important Note**: Since `bfcl_eval` automatically installs the `pathlib` library (which is already built into Python 3.5+ environments), use the `--no-deps` parameter to skip automatic installation of additional dependencies to avoid version conflicts.

🔗 OCRBench_v2 Dataset Evaluation Support (Optional)
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/datasets/ocrbench_v2.txt
```

### 📦 Installation Method - One-Click Install (Alternative)

AISBench also provides a one-click installation method, suitable for quick experience and evaluation scenarios based on preset configuration files. Ensure the installation environment has internet access.
- Basic functionality installation command:
```shell
pip3 install ais_bench_benchmark
```
- Full functionality installation command:
```shell
pip3 install ais_bench_benchmark[full]
```


## ❌ Tool Uninstallation
To uninstall AISBench Benchmark, execute the following command:
```shell
pip3 uninstall ais_bench_benchmark
```


## 🚀 Quick Start
### Pre-execution Preparation

- You need to prepare an inference service that supports the `v1/chat/completions` sub-service. Refer to 🔗 [VLLM Start OpenAI-Compatible Server](https://docs.vllm.com.cn/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#openai-compatible-server) to start the inference service.
- You need to prepare the GSM8K dataset. You can download it from the 🔗 [GSM8K dataset archive provided by OpenCompass](http://opencompass.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/datasets/data/gsm8k.zip). After decompression, place the `gsm8k/` folder under the `ais_bench/datasets` directory of the AISBench evaluation tool root path.

### Start Evaluation (Choose one of two methods)

| ⭐ Recommended: Use Custom Configuration File      | Alternative: Use Command-Line Parameters (Original Quick Start)                |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| Modify one file to centrally manage all configurations, write configurations at any path | Specify via `--models` and `--datasets` parameters |
| Write once, reuse many times            | Each run requires entering the full command                  |
| Supports full Python syntax for flexible extension | Only supports Cartesian product combinations                |

**⭐ Recommended: Use Custom Configuration File**

AISBench provides a preset custom configuration file [model_api_test_en.py](ais_bench/configs/model_api_test_en.py), which centralizes common inference service-deployed test configurations (model selection, service address, port, generation parameters, etc.) in one file, eliminating the need to look up and modify multiple configuration files. The file is essentially a Python script that supports all Python syntax, allowing you to freely extend it.

Open `ais_bench/configs/model_api_test_en.py` and modify the following configuration according to your actual situation (if you installed the tool via `pip3 install ais_bench_benchmark`, you can create `model_api_test_en.py` at any path and write the following configuration content into that file):

```python
from mmengine.config import read_base

with read_base():
# Model task, select one. For other model tasks, see: https://ais-bench-benchmark-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/models.html for more model tasks
    # vllm_api_general is a base model that only supports text generation
    from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.models.vllm_api.vllm_api_general import models as vllm_api_general
    # vllm_api_general_chat is a chat model that supports dialogue
    from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.models.vllm_api.vllm_api_general_chat import models as vllm_api_general_chat
    # vllm_api_stream_chat is a streaming chat model that supports streaming dialogue
    from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.models.vllm_api.vllm_api_stream_chat import models as vllm_api_stream_chat
    # vllm_api_general_stream is a streaming model that supports streaming generation
    from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.models.vllm_api.vllm_api_general_stream import models as vllm_api_general_stream

# Dataset task, see: https://ais-bench-benchmark-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/datasets.html for more dataset tasks
    from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.datasets.demo.demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt import gsm8k_datasets as datasets

models = vllm_api_general_chat

models[0]["path"] = ""  # Specify the absolute path of the model serialized vocabulary file (generally not required for accuracy testing scenarios)
models[0]["model"] = "" # Specify the model name loaded on the server, configured according to the actual model name pulled by the VLLM inference service (configure as an empty string to get it automatically)
models[0]["request_rate"] = 0 # Request sending frequency: send 1 request to the server every 1/request_rate seconds; if less than 0.001, all requests are sent at once
models[0]["api_key"] = "" # Custom API key, default is an empty string
models[0]["host_ip"] = "localhost" # Specify the IP of the inference service
models[0]["host_port"] = 8080 # Specify the port of the inference service
models[0]["url"] = "" # Custom URL path for accessing the inference service (needs to be configured when the base URL is not a combination of http://host_ip:host_port; after configuration, host_ip and host_port will be ignored)
models[0]["max_out_len"] = 512 # Maximum number of tokens output by the inference service
models[0]["batch_size"] = 1 # Maximum concurrency for sending requests
models[0]["trust_remote_code"] = False # Whether the tokenizer trusts remote code, default is False
models[0]["generation_kwargs"] = dict( # Model inference parameters, configured with reference to the VLLM documentation; the AISBench evaluation tool does not process them and attaches them directly to the sent request
    temperature=0.01,
    ignore_eos=False,
)

# datasets[0]["path"] = ais_bench/datasets/gsm8k # Specify the absolute path of the dataset directory (required for accuracy testing scenarios)

work_dir = 'outputs/default/'  # Specify the working directory for saving task results and logs (default is outputs/default/)

```
> 💡 The configuration file has pre-imported common model types (`vllm_api_general`, `vllm_api_general_chat`, `vllm_api_stream_chat`, `vllm_api_general_stream`). You only need to uncomment/modify the comment to switch. For more usage of custom configuration files, please refer to 📚 [Running AISBench with Custom Configuration File](./docs/source_en/advanced_tutorials/run_custom_config.md).

For selecting, preparing, and using dataset tasks, refer to the following steps:
1. Select a dataset task in 📚 [Open-Source Datasets](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/datasets.html#id3)
2. Enter the data's 📚 [Detailed Introduction/Dataset Deployment](ais_bench/benchmark/configs/datasets/demo/README_en.md#dataset-deployment) to prepare the dataset
3. Refer to 📚 [Detailed Introduction/Available Dataset Tasks](ais_bench/benchmark/configs/datasets/demo/README_en.md#available-dataset-tasks) to select an available dataset task, and copy the corresponding task import method (e.g., `from ais_bench.benchmark.configs.datasets.demo.demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt import gsm8k_datasets as datasets`) to the custom configuration file

After modifying the configuration file, execute the following command to start the service-deployed accuracy evaluation:

```bash
ais_bench ais_bench/configs/model_api_test_en.py
```

***

**Alternative: Use Command-Line Parameters**

If you are more familiar with using command-line parameters, AISBench also supports directly specifying tasks via the `--models`, `--datasets`, and `--summarizer` parameters. The following is the command-line approach that has **exactly the same execution effect** as the above custom configuration file approach.

A single or multiple evaluation tasks executed by an AISBench command are defined by a combination of model tasks (single or multiple), dataset tasks (single or multiple), and result presentation tasks (single). Take the following AISBench command as an example:

```shell
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --summarizer example
```

This command does not specify other command-line options, so it defaults to an accuracy evaluation task, where:
- `--models` specifies the model task: the `vllm_api_general_chat` model task.
- `--datasets` specifies the dataset task: the `demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt` dataset task.
- `--summarizer` specifies the result presentation task: the `example` result presentation task (if `--summarizer` is not specified, the `example` task is used by default for accuracy evaluation scenarios). It is generally used as default and does not need to be specified in the command line (subsequent commands will omit this option).

For multi-task evaluation, refer to: 📚 [Multi-Task Evaluation in Accuracy Scenarios](./docs/source_en/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/accuracy_benchmark.md#multi-task-evaluation) and [Multi-Task Evaluation in Performance Scenarios](./docs/source_en/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/performance_benchmark.md#multi-task-evaluation).

If you need to combine evaluation tasks on your own for more flexible evaluation methods, refer to: 📚 [Running AISBench with Custom Configuration File](./docs/source_en/advanced_tutorials/run_custom_config.md#running-aisbench-with-a-custom-configuration-file).


### Task Meaning Query (Optional)
Detailed information (introduction, usage constraints, etc.) about the selected model task (`vllm_api_general_chat`), dataset task (`demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt`), and result presentation task (`example`) can be queried from the following links:
- `--models`: 📚 [Service Deployment Inference Backend](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/models.html#id2)
- `--datasets`: 📚 [Open-Source Datasets](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/datasets.html#id3) → 📚 [Detailed Introduction](ais_bench/benchmark/configs/datasets/demo/README_en.md)
- `--summarizer`: 📚 [Result Summary Tasks](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/summarizer.html)

# Modification of Configuration Files Corresponding to Tasks
Each model task, dataset task, and result presentation task corresponds to a configuration file. The content of these configuration files needs to be modified before running the command. The paths of these configuration files can be queried by adding `--search` to the original AISBench command. For example:
```shell
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --search
```
> ⚠️ **Note**: Executing the command with the `search` option will print the absolute path of the configuration file corresponding to the task.

After executing the query command, you will get the following query results:
```shell

```

- The dataset task configuration file `demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt.py` in the quick start does not require additional modifications. For an introduction to the content of the dataset task configuration file, please refer to 📚 [Configure Open-Source Datasets](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/datasets.html#id6)

The model configuration file `vllm_api_general_chat.py` contains configuration content related to model operation and needs to be modified according to actual conditions. The content that needs to be modified in the quick start is marked with comments.

> 💡 **Tip**: Some parameters in the model config above (e.g. `host_ip`, `host_port`, `model`, `url`, `max_out_len`, `generation_kwargs`, etc.) can be overridden directly on the command line without editing the config file. For example:
>
> ```bash
> ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --host-ip 127.0.0.1 --host-port 8000
> ```
>
> An explicitly specified parameter overrides the corresponding field in **all executed model configs**; only fields **already present** in the config are overridden, and unspecified parameters keep their config-file values. For the full overridable parameter list and coverage notes, refer to 📚 [User Configuration Parameters - API Model Common Override Parameters](./docs/source_en/base_tutorials/all_params/cli_args.md#api-model-common-override-parameters).

```python
from ais_bench.benchmark.models import VLLMCustomAPIChat

models = [
    dict(
        attr="service",
        type=VLLMCustomAPIChat,
        abbr='vllm-api-general-chat',
        path="",                  # Specify the absolute path of the model serialized vocabulary file (generally not required for accuracy testing scenarios)
        model="",        # Specify the name of the model loaded on the server, configured according to the actual model name pulled by the VLLM inference service (configure as an empty string to get it automatically)
        stream=False,
        request_rate=0,           # Request sending frequency: send 1 request to the server every 1/request_rate seconds; if less than 0.001, all requests are sent at once
        use_timestamp=False,      # Whether to schedule requests by dataset timestamp; used with timestamped datasets (e.g. Mooncake Trace)
        retry=2,                  # Maximum number of retries for each request
        api_key="",               # Custom API key, default is an empty string
        host_ip="localhost",      # Specify the IP of the inference service
        host_port=8080,           # Specify the port of the inference service
        url="",                   # Custom URL path for accessing the inference service (needs to be configured when the base URL is not a combination of http://host_ip:host_port; after configuration, host_ip and host_port will be ignored)
        max_out_len=512,          # Maximum number of tokens output by the inference service
        batch_size=1,             # Maximum concurrency for sending requests
        trust_remote_code=False,  # Whether the tokenizer trusts remote code, default is False;
        generation_kwargs=dict(   # Model inference parameters, configured with reference to the VLLM documentation; the AISBench evaluation tool does not process them and attaches them to the sent request
            temperature=0.01,
            ignore_eos=False,
        )
    )
]
```
# Execution Command
After modifying the configuration files, execute the command to start the service-based accuracy evaluation:
```bash
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt
```
## View Task Execution Details
After executing the AISBench command, the task management interface will display task execution status in real-time on the command line (press the "P" key to pause/resume refreshing for copying dashboard information, press "P" again to continue refreshing). The task management interface supports simultaneous monitoring of detailed execution status for multiple tasks, including task name, progress, time cost, status, log path, extended parameters and other information. For example:
```
Base path of result&log : outputs/default/20250628_151326
Task Progress Table (Updated at: 2025-11-06 10:08:21)
Page: 1/1  Total 2 rows of data
Press Up/Down arrow to page,  'P' to PAUZE/RESUME screen refresh, 'Ctrl + C' to exit

+----------------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Task Name                        |   Process | Progress                                        | Time Cost   | Status      | Log Path                                        | Extend Parameters                              |
+==================================+===========+=================================================+=============+=============+=================================================+================================================+
| vllm-api-general-chat/demo_gsm8k |    547141 | [###############               ] 4/8 [0.5 it/s] | 0:00:11     | inferencing | logs/infer/vllm-api-general-chat/demo_gsm8k.out | {'POST': 5, 'RECV': 4, 'FINISH': 4, 'FAIL': 0} |
+----------------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

```

The detailed logs of task execution will be continuously saved to the default output path, which is displayed on the real-time refreshed dashboard as `Log Path`. The `Log Path` (`logs/infer/vllm-api-general-chat/demo_gsm8k.out`) is under the `Base path` (`outputs/default/20250628_151326`). Taking the above dashboard information as an example, the path of the detailed log of task execution is:
```shell
# {Base path}/{Log Path}
outputs/default/20250628_151326/logs/infer/vllm-api-general-chat/demo_gsm8k.out
```

> 💡 If you want the detailed logs to be printed directly during execution, you can add `--debug` to the execution command:
`ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --debug`


The `Base path` (`outputs/default/20250628_151326`) contains all the task execution details. After the command execution is completed, all execution details are as follows:
```shell
20250628_151326/
